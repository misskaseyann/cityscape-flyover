Random colorful polygonal prisms are generated on a plane. The camera/plane flys over the generated "cityscape" with the following controls:
* Up + Down Arrows: move the plane forward or backward.
* Left + Right Arrows: roll the plane left or right.
* W + S Keys: change the pitch of the plane forward or backward.
* D + A Keys: change the yaw of the plane right or left.
